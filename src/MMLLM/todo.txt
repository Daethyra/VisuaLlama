1. Split MultimodalAssistant into two classes
    - Abstract the:
        * Model loading via Transformers 
        * DETR processing
        * Llama generation sequencing

-Replace hardcoded settings like pool size and query timeout with configurable options. You can use environment variables, config files, or command-line arguments for this.
Implement dynamic scaling for the connection pool. Monitor the queue length and scale the pool size up or down based on the demand.
-Use a caching mechanism to improve performance. Store the results of frequently executed queries in cache to reduce database load.
-Integrate these features into a single optimization module that can be easily plugged into the main database module.

-Start by understanding the data model of your application. Know what kind of data you'll be storing and how it will be related.
-For data validation:
Use Python libraries like Pydantic or Marshmallow to validate the incoming data against predefined schemas.
Implement these validations in the validate_data method.
-For schema handling:
Write SQL scripts to create or update your database schema.
Implement a method to run these scripts in the handle_schema method.
Make these methods configurable so that they can be reused in future projects. You can use YAML or JSON files to define your schemas and validation rules.
Test these implementations rigorously to ensure they meet your scalability and reliability requirements.
Document the methods and configurations so that they can be easily understood and modified in the future.
