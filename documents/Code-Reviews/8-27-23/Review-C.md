# Mini-Roadmap for Code Review & Cleanup

## Overview

This document serves as a mini-roadmap aimed at guiding the development and improvement of the CLIP-LLaMA 2 Chat project, which involves image description and text-based conversation. The modules in focus are `utility.py`, `image_describer.py`, `llama2chat.py`, and `main.py`.

## Module-Specific Plan

### `utility.py`

#### Phase 1: Code Cleanup

1. **Add Type Annotations**
   * **Why** : To improve code readability and self-documentation.
   * **Where** : Function definitions in `utility.py`.

#### Phase 2: Logging and Debugging

1. **Add Logging**
   * **Why** : To track the execution flow and facilitate debugging.
   * **Where** : Inside exception handling blocks.

### `image_describer.py`

#### Phase 1: Code Cleanup

1. **Add Type Annotations**
   * **Why** : To improve code readability and self-documentation.
   * **Where** : Function definitions in `image_describer.py`.

#### Phase 3: Functionality and Features

1. **Optimize Image Processing**
   * **Why** : To improve performance and speed.
   * **Where** : In the `describe_image` method.

#### Phase 4: Exception Handling

1. **Add Finer-grained Error Messages**
   * **Why** : To provide more context when errors occur.
   * **Where** : In the `except` blocks.

### `llama2chat.py`

#### Phase 1: Code Cleanup

1. **Add Type Annotations**
   * **Why** : To improve code readability and self-documentation.
   * **Where** : Function definitions in `llama2chat.py`.

#### Phase 2: Logging and Debugging

1. **Add Logging**
   * **Why** : To track execution and facilitate debugging.
   * **Where** : Inside exception handling blocks and significant operations.

### `main.py`

#### Phase 1: Code Cleanup

1. **Refactor Code for Clarity**
   * **Why** : To make the code easier to read and maintain.
   * **Where** : Throughout `main.py`.

#### Phase 4: Exception Handling

1. **Improve Error Responses**
   * **Why** : To provide more informative and user-friendly error messages.
   * **Where** : In the `except` blocks within FastAPI endpoints.

## Scalability and Performance

1. **Implement Caching**
   * **Why** : To improve response time by avoiding repetitive computations.
   * **Where** : In `llama2chat.py` for caching user needs, and `image_describer.py` for caching image features.

---

## Questions to Address

1. **Question** : How to efficiently manage model loading?

* Context: Currently managed in `utility.py`.

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize tasks starting with code cleanup for readability.
2. Implement tasks one phase at a time.
3. Review code quality and functionality after each phase.
