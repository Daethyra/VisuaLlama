#### Prioritize the following modules once the current module set is finished(as of 8/29/23):

1. **Database Manager** : To handle database operations like session storage, history, and any other persistent data. This will be crucial for testing stateful interactions.
3. **Authentication Manager** : For managing user authentication, including session tokens. This will enable you to run tests simulating different user accounts.
4. **Logging Manager** : A dedicated module for handling logging across all other modules. This will be useful for debugging and auditing during and after tests.
5. **Error Handler** : A module for handling all kinds of errors and exceptions that might occur during testing or production.
6. **Rate Limiter** : To test the system's behavior under different load conditions, you can implement a rate limiter.
7. **Test Suite (test_suite.py)** : A dedicated module for running a suite of tests on other modules. This module could include unit tests, integration tests, and even end-to-end tests.
