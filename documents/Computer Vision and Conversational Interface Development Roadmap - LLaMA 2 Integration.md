# Computer Vision and Conversational Interface Development Roadmap: LLaMA 2 Integration

## 1. Project Overview

### Objective

Build a system that uses computer vision to analyze images and a conversational model (LLaMA 2) to interpret natural language requests.

### Use Case Example

User wants to count yellow and brown boxes in an image. They take a picture, upload it, and send a message. The system handles the rest.

## 2. Dynamic Prompt Generation

### 2.1 Context Recognition

- Identify what objects need to be analyzed (e.g., yellow and brown boxes).
- Design a method to pass this context to the following steps.

### 2.2 Prompt Chain Creation

- Develop flexible templates that can handle various scenarios.
- Ensure that the templates work with the LLaMA 2 model structure.
- Test different prompts for efficiency and effectiveness.

## 3. Integration with Computer Vision

### 3.1 Image Feature Extraction

- Select appropriate computer vision model(s) for object detection.
- Consider how to handle color recognition (e.g., yellow, brown).

### 3.2 Integration with Natural Language Processing

- Establish seamless communication between the computer vision and LLaMA 2 models.
- Ensure accurate translation of image features into natural language and vice versa.

## 4. Natural Language Handling with LLaMA 2

### 4.1 Response Generation

- Implement LLaMA 2 for natural language responses to user queries.
- Maintain conversation context across interactions.

### 4.2 Natural Language Analysis

- Utilize LLaMA 2 to understand and process user's natural language inputs.
- Consider scalability and how to handle various user input types.

## 5. Testing and Iteration

### 5.1 Prototype Testing

- Build prototypes and test with real-world scenarios.
- Identify gaps and areas for improvement.

### 5.2 Continuous Improvement

- Implement feedback loops for continuous enhancement.
- Consider how to handle updates to underlying models (e.g., LLaMA 2).

## 6. Special Considerations

### 6.1 Accessibility and User Experience

- Design an intuitive user interface.
- Ensure accessibility for various user groups.

### 6.2 Future Opportunities

- Keep in mind the potential for extending functionality (e.g., special token handling).
