1. **Task_Name**
   - **Why**: Reason for the task.
   - **Where**: Location in the code where the task should be implemented.

#### Phase 3: Functionality and Features

1. **Task_Name**
   - **Why**: Reason for the task.
   - **Where**: Location in the code where the task should be implemented.

#### Phase 4: Exception Handling

1. **Task_Name**
   - **Why**: Reason for the task.
   - **Where**: Location in the code where the task should be implemented.

#### Phase 5: Testing

1. **Task_Name**
