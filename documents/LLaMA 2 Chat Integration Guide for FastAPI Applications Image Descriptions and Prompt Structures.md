# LLaMA 2 Chat Integration Guide for FastAPI Applications: Image Descriptions and Prompt Structures

## Introduction

This guide details the integration of the LLaMA 2 Chat model into a FastAPI application to generate descriptions for images. The model is trained to understand specific prompt structures for single-turn and multi-turn conversations.

## How to Prompt LLaMA 2 Chat

Interacting with LLaMA 2 Chat effectively requires providing the right prompts and questions. Below are the prompt templates for both single-turn and multi-turn conversations:

### Single-turn

```plaintext

<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

{{ system_prompt }}

<</SYS>>


{{ user_message }} [/INST]

```

### Multi-turn

```plaintext

<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

{{ system_prompt }}

<</SYS>>


{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} </s><s>[INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_2 }} </s><s>[INST] {{ user_msg_3 }} [/INST]

```

## Usage

### Import Libraries

Import the required libraries, including transformers and CLIP.

### Initialize Models

Initialize the LLaMA 2 Chat model and the CLIP model.

### Preprocess Image

Preprocess the image using the CLIP transform.

### Extract Features

Extract features from the image using the CLIP model.

### Construct Dialog

Construct the dialog using the appropriate prompt structure (single-turn or multi-turn) and include the extracted image features.

### Generate Description

Generate the description using the LLaMA 2 Chat model.

## Dependencies

- transformers
- CLIP
- FastAPI
- PIL

## Conclusion

Follow the prompt structure as described above for proper interaction with the LLaMA 2 Chat model. Ensure that the system prompt and user messages are formatted correctly.
