### System Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Pillow
- TensorFlow
- Transformers library

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Module Structure

The `VILTChatbotModule` class is the core component, providing methods for image loading and answer prediction.

- `__init__`: Initialize the pre-trained models.
- `load_image`: Load images from various formats.
- `predict_answer`: Generate answers based on image and text input.

### API Endpoints

Create FastAPI endpoints to interact with the module:

- `/predict`: POST endpoint to receive image and text, and return the predicted answer.

### Error Handling

The module includes robust error handling, using Python's logging module to log errors and exceptions.

### Scaling and Performance

The module is designed to be stateless, making it easy to scale horizontally. For performance considerations, the module leverages TensorFlow for accelerated computations.

### Examples

Examples of API requests and responses will be provided to facilitate integration.

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and their resolutions will be listed.
